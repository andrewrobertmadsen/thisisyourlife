        When I was a kid, my parents didn’t talk a lot about money. My Mom and
        Dad both worked normal jobs and I never went without. My Mom encouraged
        me to pursue a career in medicine as a doctor but I didn’t really give
        it much thought until college. I knew I liked biology from high school
        so I decalred a biology major thinking it a good fit for pre-med and
        began my course work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-med was tough, and not just the course work. It required voluteering
        for many hours in medical settings with little to no monetary
        compensation. That was something I just couldn’t do coming from a middle
        class family and being newly married. I had rent to pay and food to
        provide. So I threw in the towel to persue a degree in chemistry
        thinking to be a professor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around this time my mother's health took a turn for the worse and I
        realized that right now was not the time that I wanted to head out of
        state to graduate school. With little prospect of achieving
        professorship in chemistry by persuing grad school at any of the
        in-state colleges, I found myself searching for a career to pursue yet
        again.
      </p>

        I happend upon the field of environmental engineering (a sub-domain of
        civil engineering), heard it payed an salary of $80,000, and involved a
        fair bit of chemistry. Having no clue what life cost and that being one
        of the higher salaries I had heard I decided to pursue a master's degree
        in the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Environmental engineering was a good decision looking back. It was
        rigorous and intruduced me to the skill that got me to my current
        career. I still remember my first job offer in the field. I was offered
        $23 per hour. I couldn't believe it. I was raking in the dough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward 5 years and I was indeed making the $80,000 per year that I
        had dreamed of with litle prospect of my salary growing much futher than
        $90,000 in the next 5-10 years. Now don't get me wrong, finacially we
        were doing okay. We had a house and cars that worked most of the time.
        But went weren't saving for retirement like we needed to and student
        loan payments that I knew would crush us were looming on the horizon.
        With little prospect of a drastically different salary, I began to worry
        how it was all going to work out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting to the chase, I made a career pivot to data engineering. It was
        what I actually did for the engineering firms I worked for already so
        that made the transition easier. With the career change came a higher
        salary that allowed us to more comfortably meet our financial demands
        and even check off a few finacial dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find myself often reflecting on my career choices that got me hear,
        wondering if there was a shorter path. I also am constantly amazed at my
        lack of knowldge about what life actually costs and how much money some
        people actually make. I know they say that money can't buy you happiness
        and I knew my fair share of people who are well off and miserable. But I
        also can't deny that my neighbors look pretty happy tearing around on
        their side-by-sides and heading out on the new boat to wakeskating.

        My purpose in creating this site is a hope that maybe someone younger
        than I will use it to gain some insight into what life costs, what
        careers pay enough to deliver the lifestyle they want, and avoid the
        trap that I fell into of not reconciling income with lifestyle. May you
        be able to prepare yourself to live out your finacial dreams better than
        I was prepared is my wish to you all.
